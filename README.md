# elevator-system

This is an djangoREST based application which handles single button based elevator system.
This is a backend project where we can trigger the different APIs from web browser or Postman with necessary inputs to perform corresponding actions.

**Models used for the project**
We are maintaining two tables: Elevator and Request
**1. Elevator:**
elevator_id - Unique id assigned to every elevator
cur_floor - Stores the floor number on which elevator is currently present.
is_available - Identifies if an elevator is under maintenance("No") or is working("Yes").
status - Stores current status of Elevator(**OPEN**: The elevator door is open, **STOP**: The elevator is idle, **UP**: The elevator is going Up, **DOWN**: The elevator is going Down) 
          _We are assuming that the elevator door is closed if the status != "OPEN"_

**2. Request:**
req_id - Unique id for each request(Call an elevator or intrust the elevator to go to any floor after entering)
dest_floor - tores the desired destination of the request made.
assigned_elevator_id - Stores the id of the elevator that is assigned to complete this request.
is_pending - "Yes/No" based on the fact that an elevator is assigned to the request or not.

**APIs used in the Application:**

**1. api/initialize/**
**GET** reuest can be made to fetch all the elevators from database.

We can initialize new Elevators in our database by making a **POST** request to this API by giving the number of elevators as json input.
For example:
JSON input- {
"num" : 5
}
 This will add 5 new elevators in the database.

**2. api/available/**
**POST** request can be made to enter if an elevator is under maintenance or not. Availability = "No" means elevator is under maintenance. We send the elevator id and new availability status.
{
"id": 1,
"availability" : "No"
}

Updates the is_available value for the given elevator_id

**3. api/door/**

**POST** request to open or close the elevator door. Inputs should be like below example,
{
"id": 1,
"status": "OPEN"
}
This will change the status of elevator 1 to OPEN. The accepatable inputs for status i this API call are OPEN/CLOSE.

**4. api/fetchRequests/**

**POST** request to fetch all the requests for the elevator_id.
{
"id" : 2
}
Fetches all the requests made to elevator 2.

**5. api/callElevator/**

**POST** request made when a user wants to call nearest elevator to their current floor.
Example,
{
"floor_id": 5
}

This will looks for the available elevators in the database that are not busy currently. This means, **is_available = "Yes" and status = "STOP"**. 
We are assuming that if an elevator door is open or the elevator is moving up/down it is busy with some other request.
We add the new request to the database, along with **algorithmically assigned elevator id**
We change the cur_floor of the assigned elevator to the requested floor number. Also, we change the status of the assigned elevator to "OPEN" as it is engaged with a user request now.

**Response**:
{
    "message": "Assigned elevator id is 5. Your elevator has reached floor number 5. The doors are open"
}


**6. api/enterFloor/**

We are assuming that when this **POST** request is made the user is inside the assigned elevator for that floor currently and the elevator doors are open.
Example,
{
"cur_floor": 5,
"floors": "6 7 2"
}

Here the current floor is 5 from where user is giving this request. Let's assume the assigned elevator_id is 2.

**Algorithm**

- Fetch the available elevator for which cur_floor is 5 and status is OPEN
- We will rearrange the requested floor numbers according to the travelling salesman problem. We find the shortest path to cover all the floors.**(In this case, 6, 7, 2)**
- To travel to each floor we are performing below steps:
  - Close the elevalor door and decide if it have to move Up/Down.
  - Change the cur_floor for the elevator to this floor(eg, 6)
  - Open the door of the elevator on the new floor.
  - After all the floor are visited we change the status of elevator to STOP, as it is idle now and can take up new requests.
- We are logging the elevator movements and returning them as a response.

**Response:**

{
    "lst_of_floors": "6,7,2",
    "message": "Door closed!! Going UP Reached floor number 6. Door opened!Door closed!! Going UP Reached floor number 7. Door opened!Door closed!! Going DOWN Reached floor number 2. Door opened!"
}
